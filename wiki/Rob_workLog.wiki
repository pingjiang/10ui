This is the work log of Rob Evans, that is all.
===Fri 10/5/07===
   * Working on manager related stuff
      * Modified definition so managers now deal with !UIComponents instead of !InteractiveObjects
      * Implementing !SelectManager::update function
         * Checks for chg in !UserInput
         * If chg = select => package
         * Get objects that are at pt (x,y)
         * See which if any are registered with the manager
         * If registered, tell them to process the event
      * Implementing !InteractiveObject::select(Event evt) function
         * Takes event, get event handlers for evt->evtName
         * Process all event handlers for evtName
      * Made !DisplayObject a subclass of !EventDispatcher
   * TODO:
      * Implement !EventHandler::process(Event evt)
      * Update !UserInput to deal with data for new architecture
      * Update Event to handle necessary data
